FoodieDash is a **demo food delivery website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It simulates a modern multi-page flow for food ordering:  

➡️ **Home → Restaurant Menu → Cart → Checkout**  

Perfect for learning how to structure a simple multi-page website, use localStorage for cart data, and deploy with GitHub Pages.
